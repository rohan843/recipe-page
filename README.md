## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Majorly, the following (retrospectively, not that complex) method to add space between a list item and the list marker:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Extra Spacing!</li>
  <li>Regular Spacing</li>
</ol>
```

```css
li:first-child {
  padding-left: 20px;
}
```
